I fully support and endorse the the ThreeFold Foundation vision of a decentralised, sustainable and greener internet that provides lower cost computational power and connectivity to large groups of people who , until today, have been excluded from the benefits and possibilities inherent in the digital revolution.

bio = "Mike encountered ThreeFold at a moment in his life when giving back and making a tangible contribution towards a better World had become a personal priority. Conscious of both his own, and his familyâ€™s, good fortune by accident of birth and access to good education and healthcare Mike is motivated to extend the life possibilities that the fortunate take for granted to the hundreds of millions of children, who through no fault of their own, face a challenging future. Mike has worked in the Technology and Media space in both London and New York for the past 30 years most recently as Chairman and CEO of a US public software company. His journey with ThreeFold began in 2017 and in 2018 he co-founded Green Edge which has become one of the larger independent farmers on the ThreeFold Grid with computing and storage capacity located in 6 countries in Europe and North America. He has an extensive network in financial, technology and media circles on both sides of the Atlantic which he plans to involve in expanding ThreeFold activities and programs into Africa and South America. Many major companies are looking to improve their environmental sustainability governance (ESG) impact, Mike looks forward to involving these entities in supporting the impact activities of the ThreeFold Foundation."

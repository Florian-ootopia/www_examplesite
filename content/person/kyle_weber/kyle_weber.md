bio: Kyle has spent the last 10 years working in/on sustainability projects ranging from large scale commercial solar farms to rural NGO tuberculosis control programs. He has worked on a number of startups and founder of EVERA, a Dubai-based organization trying to make mobility more sustainable. Everyday he tries very hard not to be an idiot, or take himself too seriously. Sometimes he is successful.
excerpt: Ambassador fell in love with Threefold I believe in ThreeFold Foundation because I believe in the people behind the movement.

bio = "Brian has a passion for creating solutions that go beyond the screen: he cares about the inner workings, but also about their impact in the world. As a detail oriented and organized person, he makes an excellent team lead. He keeps his teams working productively and motivated, foreseeing needs and challenges in advance. He was attracted to technology and science since he was a child, so he decided to study Computer Science after realizing the power of programming over matter. Brian is, by far, the best dancer on the team. A few years ago, swing and blues dancing was a hobby, but soon it turned into a passion that took him on several trips around the world. Now he organizes events, participates in competitions and teaches."

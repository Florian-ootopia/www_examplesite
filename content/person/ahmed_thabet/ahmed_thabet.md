bio = "I believe that life is a chance to grow a soul and programming is one of my means towards that goal. I want to build beautiful applications that don't productize the user or invade their privacy. Giving them their freedom back and complete control over their data. What I've seen in threefold for ~4+ years is lots of great values I'd like to have in this world. I'm mainly involved in the development user-facing technologies e.g SDK, wikis, websites, and infrastructure setup of Threefold."

bio = "I’m known to seek anything disruptive and innovative, and especially unexpected things that take me out of my comfort zone. Above all I love to “simply” engage with entrepreneurs, startups, blockchain and crypto companies, and (interesting and smarter than me) people, or with an audience when speaking on a stage. I regularly enthral audiences across continents as I share my experience and expertise in the form of Keynote speaking covering topics such as Governance, the role and impact of Blockchain in today's society and the business component of technology."

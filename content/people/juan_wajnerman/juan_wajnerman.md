bio = "Juan is a natural pathfinder and we all feel safe when he is leading the way. He shines the brightest when he has the chance to work on problems with no immediate solution, and is a skilled craftsman when it comes to building a solid structure for others to join and collaborate. Wise and patient, he might seem a private person. Once you get to know him and he sees the opportunity to express his ideas, he will bring well founded opinions and solutions to the team. To unwind after a long day, Juan enjoys cooking and has delighted us several times with his skills as a chef. He is currently learning how to play the piano and fly a plane, and is one of the proud creators of Crystal."

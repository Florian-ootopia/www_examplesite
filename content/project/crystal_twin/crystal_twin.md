# Crystal Twin

## About

*Crystal Twin* is your digital twin, a beautiful light being that is always connected with you, 24h per day, 7 days per week. A digital avatar of your being that sets you free, independently capable, grows into anything as required in the new Crystal Universe, a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer ecosystem that upholds their human counterpart’s  digital privacy and freedom. Every Crystal Twin can interact and learn from each other in the Crystal Universe and they realize they need their peers to become stronger together.

## Mission

Our mission is to shape a conscious digital world together. The world where all individuals, across regions have equal chances to learn, partake, and succeed. A world where freedom and liberalism are at the center. We are building a world where we live sustainably and where we think circularly. The priority is to ensure the best environment possible for us and all living species of this plant. Creating circular economies that use resources consciously, and where that which has true value becomes the center. Future economies will be digital and promote sustainability.

## Impact

Today's economies are successful when depleting our planet's resources. This is a flawed approach to value creation. Crystal Twin will connect you to new sustainable digital economies that help drive success through green initiatives and value exchanges that live through Crystal experiences, minimizing carbon footprint, using resources consciously and creating a world where we live sustainably and through digital economies that promotes sustainability.

While Crystal Twin may seem like a technological solution, its roots and goals are strongly humanitarian. Every person who signs up for Crystal Twin makes a significant impact. The P2P infrastructure is up to 10x more efficient and sustainable and ensures that data privacy and security is preserved. The internet cost is less than half a dollar a month per user, greatly increasing access to underserved communities. 

Additionally, the Crystal Universe ecosystem is creating a number of P2P experiences and solutions such as videoconferencing, file storage and social networking that will impact both the effectiveness and security of online communication.

 ## Powered by ThreeFold  

Crystal Twin is built by Crystal Company, and lives on Threefold grid, serving as your digital self to the new digital world - the Crystal Universe - a new internet and peer-to-peer experiences. Developers, creators, and users can create their own experiences within the Crystal Universe, functionalities and features within the Threefold Grid’s peer-to-peer ecosystem.

## Support this project

Crystal Twin is included in ThreeFold’s [Token Distribution Event (TDE)](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/tdeoverview)</a> for the impact it brings to our planet, humanity and the ThreeFold Grid.
The ThreeFold Token (TFT) represents a unit of capacity on the new Internet and is created only when new capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.
Each project on the TDE benefits from TFT fund allocations. You can buy TFT's and support Crystal Twin, and the growth of a new Conscious Internet.


### Roadmap

[milestone]
name = "Crystal Public Release v.1"
#date format: Q YYYY
date = "Q4 2020 - Q1 2021"
funding_required_tft = "1,000,000"
funding_required_usd = ""
description = "The Crystal Twin public release will include Crystal Connect, p2p video conferencing, p2p social network, decentralized file storage, browser and wallet. It will also include the Crystal SDK which will allow developers to begin building the ecosystem of Crystal experiences. There is no need for hundreds of different apps, there should only be 1, our digital twin should be that app, the “life” app which allows us to re-experience the simplicity of our childhood. A place where we are protected and have connection to the universal truth."

## Mission

Our mission is to make people happier by providing a new perspective on their lifestyle and empowering them to act on Earth’s global problems.

## Impact

COVID-19 mitigation is a great example of what can be done when we act together. Vlinder helps people become more mindful about their consumption behaviour and investments and empowers them to act on climate change. If we join forces, we can face any challenge, even climate change.

## Powered by ThreeFold

Vlinder will provide carbon offset options for ThreeFold ecosystem making it planet-positive and optimize its own running costs using ThreeFold infrastructure.

## Join saving our planet!

We invite you to join us on this journey of creating an ecosystem for conscious consumption and sustainable financial decisions.
How can you contribute? First of all, by becoming our first user. [The Vlinder app beta](https://vlinder.app) is available for iOS and Android in the eurozone countries.
If you are in Germany or Austria and run a sustainable business or manage an impact community, feel free to reach out to us to discuss possible partnerships.

## Support this project

Vlinder is included in ThreeFold’s [Token Distribution Event (TDE)](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/tdeoverview)</a> for the impact it brings to our planet, humanity and the ThreeFold Grid.
The ThreeFold Token (TFT) represents a unit of capacity on the new Internet and is created only when new capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.
Each project on the TDE benefits from TFT fund allocations. You can buy TFT's and support Vlinder, and the growth of a new Conscious Internet.

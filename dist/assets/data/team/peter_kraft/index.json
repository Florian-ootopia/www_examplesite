I retired end of 2017, still eagerly following new technologies as I am an engineer with a Mechanical Engineering diploma from TU Graz, Austria. I am married, have 2 adult daughters, love computers and DIY repairs of any kind, my motorbike and Pilates and engage myself in charity clubs since 30 years. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold I learned about ThreeFold from Owen Kemp and Wolfgang Wittmer and was fascinated immediately by the TF approach. Although being a manager almost all of the time of my business life, I am “technology affine” and always interested in new technologies and advances in IT technology, which I follow closely. In HPE, for example, I was also an evangelist for MDC – Memory Driven Compute – a fundamentally new approach to compute architecture based on HP’s famous “The Machine” lab project (see www.labs.hpe.com/the-machine ). I like the idea to build a digitally responsible internet as well as taking social responsibility to bring affordable compute resources to the world, especially the 3rd world. I followed grid and blockchain technologies from the early days (on a high level, not as a programmer, which I am not) and I am happy to see that there are now realistically useable and reasonable approaches like TF proposes. I understand that this is all still in early stages and this is why I want to become a TF Ambassador, Contributing to the community and helping to find business opportunities and other potential contributors and supporters in my own personal network. I am eager to become part of the TF community to learn more about this exciting new approach.","excerpt":"Worked 35 years for HP/HPE as sales/product manager/EMEA Director for Business Critical Server Business.","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-kraft-3775931/","websites":"","countries":["Austria"],"cities":[],"private":1,"image":{"type":"image","mimeType":"image/jpeg","src":"/assets/static/peter_kraf.a68c322.f7dad22c3e5d46e484471f5f19201f60.jpg","size":{"width":150,"height":150},"sizes":"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px","srcset":["/assets/static/peter_kraf.a68c322.f7dad22c3e5d46e484471f5f19201f60.jpg 150w"],"dataUri":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg fill='none' viewBox='0 0 150 150' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' xmlns:xlink='http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'%3e%3cdefs%3e%3cfilter id='__svg-blur-4fa9a53e571c54dfc5d720b3414813c7'%3e%3cfeGaussianBlur in='SourceGraphic' stdDeviation='40'/%3e%3c/filter%3e%3c/defs%3e%3cimage x='0' y='0' filter='url(%23__svg-blur-4fa9a53e571c54dfc5d720b3414813c7)' width='150' height='150' xlink:href='data:image/jpeg%3bbase64%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%2b0zHsdx9UU928TySFg4Cv0OM9M1BmdKxI7Y7uGhJPXGSf5qMap0QzPaUpsBuQn%2bxQT9j51Et/828ufpwC5B3mr6Kofsj7QZ8S5W7T9/fMmPKHdRnnDlxlwZHdqPNScjAJ33G9XxSKsGGRC2UqcGFFFFamZU/b6DLg2i3lQDTjjj6xjc8KQkfdZpFpi3NsREBpscueK7/iAEqKxaZ0RlMjK1Ry2pRTgnC%2bIeyTtTRbp0tgNd0uSpwDC1pCUtZxyCSMkeW9GXi6nGTFLJ9KbSWts8Sl8LecbZxTXeGWywtQ4SQN8cx603LvlznQowKY7YlBYHd8RVkZwMnbfB6Ujf8ArEwSlEdphZUEhTaskgkDxJPXfpUfbU7ZlZdvOJWGvFu2u5RZUP8ALMcl5K0nBJKs/IzWwoMhEuExJbOUPNpcSf0Iz/7WWJWnZr19LE25KmAIUCrukNgJIOQEj5Od60ro5SlaXtgWkJ4WEIGOqQMA/wAAUpbOCNMMuaRA1n3Hiiio5rbW1g0VbjM1DcGowI/LaHiddPkhA3PwOtVyOfjtHt39R0fcOBKTIjIMpkkclt%2bID3AKfeqvsriJNpUuM66EOIBSkYBCSOWeYqIaw/E47JZkRtM2BLba0lAkXBYUSD/qTty6FVcOynVjd6scmM93cWe2okJQPCASSnA8sbe1Q3qkAOIl0%2bsFyh5k/ZbZTaogZVkt5HAEnw77Z8qWuLQWkqWFrcRulZO38edMMWVdHY3cCMylecd4p1w55bhIwPPrjenOJHXBgqbedW88tW6lqyB6eQo0nSNoocgZP9%2bJGHpDkfUa3W93XWyhtOMlSsjAA5n2rQ1mYVFtEJhYwttlCFD9QkZrGna1O%2btdLbSiktqUtC0HBCk8iCK4dm3bxqTSMhqNdn3b3aBspmQvLzY/Y4d/ZWR6UtZ0StMOeYRfVgzCmOP3NuqIAJJwB1rz%2b7XdQuat7Q7xdFuFbIeLEbySyg4SB9z6k1uLtBuQtGiL7OKuEsw3Sk/uKSB9yK89Cck5686sEgiZTZSM8xUs06/JtTMadGWG3O%2b8WRspsgDB%2bfao22nicShRCUnmT0HWl7N045RbcOIitkIPJI6V6oqNlX52mSzKQy8TRll1nCEcGcl1qQkAFAbJGfMEcxXC73x65qCIhUxHSCVOE4Uc/G1V7pq8sqQiPLdCHQOFp5R8K/IE9D686%2barvjjzbsCKoDi2eW2rbH%2bIPyfahvh9XvdrH3%2bnuNNe0uz3M7euc%2bowavmiQ4440MMpBS3/AMjr75qv1pyAcZxT9NlJUt2KjxJCDuDkAgbge3xTEM01UVUARfA2gutqhLt5M//Z' /%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"belongsTo":{"totalCount":0,"pageInfo":{"totalPages":1,"currentPage":1},"edges":[]}},"memberships":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"foundation","title":"foundation","path":"/team/memberships/foundation/"}},{"node":{"id":"tech","title":"tech","path":"/team/memberships/tech/"}}]}},"context":{}}
